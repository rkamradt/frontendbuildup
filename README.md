frontendbuildup
===============

building up a front end from a single HTML file

[ ![Codeship Status for rkamradt/frontendbuildup](https://www.codeship.io/projects/e31831e0-2652-0132-6bb3-260c56419231/status)](https://www.codeship.io/projects/37436)

This repository goes along with a series of blog posts starting with
[Tackling the front end](https://rlkamradt.wordpress.com/2014/06/03/tackling-the-front-end/)

Although the title is Tackling the front end, My intention is to build up the front-end and then
create a back-end that will service it.  This is an open ended project that will cease when I
tire of it.

The blog posts correspond with git tags of the form backbone-buildup-n where n is the number
of the blog post in the series, unless the post is just another one of my rants and has no
code changes associated with it.
